# **Interview Preparation**

---

## **Prepare Strategically**

* Research the company, role and industry.
* Understand the company’s goals and link them to your skills using concrete examples.
* Use tools like **Gemini Deep Research** or **NotebookLM** to gather detailed insights.
* Prepare answers for common questions (strengths/weaknesses, challenges, teamwork, etc.).
* Select 5 strong STAR stories (Situation, Task, Action, Result).

## **STAR Method**

* **Situation:** Set the context clearly.
* **Task:** Explain your responsibility.
* **Action:** Describe steps you personally took.
* **Result:** Share measurable outcomes + what you learned.
* Use STAR for challenges, successes, conflicts, failures, and improvements.

## **Practice Confidently**

* Practice answers aloud with a friend, mentor, or **Gemini Live** for real-time feedback.
* Give Gemini details about your upcoming interview to get relevant practice questions.
* Rehearse until answers sound natural—not memorized.

## **Ask Thoughtful Questions**

* Candidate should ask questions about the role, team, and company.
* Examples:

  * “How does this role contribute to broader company goals?”
  * “How does the team collaborate and give feedback?”
  * “What are the company’s key priorities for the next 1–3 years?”
* Tailor questions using insights from Gemini Deep Research or NotebookLM.

## **Post-Interview Etiquette**

* Send a thank-you email within 24 hours.
* Keep it personal, brief, and specific to your conversation.

## **Handling Job Offers**

* Respond professionally and promptly.
* It’s okay to take time—give a clear decision timeline.
* Research market salary before negotiating.
* Show enthusiasm whether accepting or declining.

## **Handling Rejection**

* Rejection isn’t personal—it’s about fit.
* Every interview provides experience and growth.
* Ask to be kept in mind for future roles.
* Reflect on what went well and what can improve next time.
