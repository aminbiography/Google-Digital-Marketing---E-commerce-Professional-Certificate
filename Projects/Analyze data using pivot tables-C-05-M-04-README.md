# Project Title: **Optimizing Ad Strategy Through Conversion Rate Analysis**

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to identify high- and low-performing time blocks based on conversion rate (CVR) and session data. By analyzing patterns with pivot tables, the goal is to recommend strategic ad scheduling that maximizes conversions while reducing wasted spend.

## Project Scenario

The marketing team runs digital ads across multiple time blocks, but not all periods yield equal results. Sessions peak at certain times, yet conversions do not always follow the same pattern. A data-driven approach is required to find optimal times to scale advertising and periods to cut back.

## Project Description

* The dataset included hourly session and conversion data across all days of the week.
* Pivot tables were used to summarize data by **Day of Week** and **Hour of Day**, calculating both raw conversions and conversion rate (CVR).

* A benchmark CVR of **≈12.75%** was established to classify “high” vs. “low” conversion periods.
* Insights revealed that **moderate session blocks with high CVR** are better investment opportunities than high traffic periods with weak conversion efficiency.
* Recommendations were consolidated into a professional stakeholder email.

## Project Conclusion

* **High-performing blocks:** Weekday afternoons and evenings, especially Monday and Tuesday (15:00–20:00). These periods consistently produced above-benchmark CVR (16–18%).
* **Low-performing blocks:** Early mornings (03:00–06:00) across weekdays and weekends, with CVR often falling below 7%.
* **Recommendation:** Increase ad spend during high CVR blocks and reduce spend during low-efficiency hours. This balances budget allocation and drives higher return on investment.
