# Project Title: **Optimizing Ad Strategy Through Conversion Rate Analysis**

---

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to identify **high-performing** and **low-performing** time blocks based on conversion rate (CVR) and session data. Using pivot tables for analysis, the goal is to recommend strategic ad scheduling that:

* Maximizes conversions
* Reduces wasted ad spend
* Improves overall marketing ROI

---

## Project Scenario

The marketing team at Lacier runs digital ad campaigns across multiple time blocks each week. While traffic (sessions) is strong during some periods, conversions do not always follow the same pattern.

A **data-driven approach** is required to:

* Detect when ads drive strong conversion rates.
* Identify periods where ad spend is wasted due to low conversion efficiency.
* Provide actionable recommendations to optimize ad scheduling.

---

## Project Description

1. **Dataset**

   * Hourly session and conversion data across all seven days of the week.
   * Metrics included: Users, Sessions, Bounce Rate, Pages/Session, Avg. Session Duration, Conversion Rate, and Conversions.

2. **Tools & Methods**

   * Pivot tables created in **Google Sheets**.
   * Rows: *Day of Week*
   * Columns: *Hour of Day*
   * Values: Sessions, Conversions, Conversion Rate (CVR).
   * Conditional formatting applied to highlight performance patterns.

3. **Benchmark**

   * Overall **average CVR = ≈12.75%**.
   * Used as the threshold to classify *high-performing* vs. *low-performing* blocks.

4. **Findings**

   * High CVR blocks often occurred during **weekday afternoons and evenings**, not necessarily during peak traffic hours.
   * Early mornings consistently underperformed with low CVR despite moderate traffic.

## Project Conclusion

* **High-performing blocks:**

  * Mondays and Tuesdays (15:00–20:00)
  * CVR consistently above **16–18%** during these hours.
  * Best time to scale ad spend.

* **Low-performing blocks:**

  * Early mornings (03:00–06:00) across weekdays and weekends.
  * CVR often falls below **7%**, making ads less effective.

* **Recommendation:**

  * **Increase ad spend** during weekday afternoons and evenings where CVR is strong.
  * **Reduce ad spend** during early mornings and midday hours with high sessions but poor conversion efficiency.
  * This strategy ensures **budget efficiency** and **higher ROI**.
