# **Project Title:** **Dress and Play Customer Satisfaction Survey**

---

### **Project Scenario:**

Dress and Play is an e-commerce store specializing in gently-used clothing and toys for babies and toddlers. To achieve a business goal of improving their conversion rate by 10%, the company aims to understand customer satisfaction levels and uncover areas for improvement in its online shopping experience. As an e-commerce analyst, I designed a customer satisfaction survey to collect valuable insights and help the brand make data-driven improvements.

**Step 2: Added Invitation Message**
Wrote a warm, playful introduction aligned with Dress and Play’s brand tone:

> “Hi there, We want to make Dress and Play even better for you and your little one. Can you take a quick survey to tell us how we’re doing and where we can improve?”

**Step 3: Added Demographic Questions**
Included three inclusive demographic questions:

1. How old is your youngest child?
2. Where do you live?
3. Which best describes you?

Each question offers multiple choices and “Prefer not to answer” options for inclusivity.

**Step 4: Added Satisfaction Scale Matrix**
Created a five-criteria matrix to assess satisfaction with product variety, quality, pricing, website ease, and checkout process, rated from *Very Satisfied* to *Very Dissatisfied.*

**Step 5: Added Net Promoter Score Question**
Included the NPS question:

> “How likely is it that you would recommend Dress and Play to a friend?”
> Scale: 1 (Not at all likely) to 10 (Extremely likely).

**Step 6: Added Open-Ended Questions**
Added two open-ended questions to encourage detailed feedback:

1. What is one thing we could improve about your Dress and Play shopping experience?
2. Is there anything you’d love to see us offer in the future (products, sizes, features, etc.)?

**Step 7: Reviewed and Finalized**
Used the “eye” preview feature to check clarity, inclusivity, and simplicity before publishing the form.
