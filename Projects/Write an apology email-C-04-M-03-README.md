## Description
The initial launch email created confusion with conflicting dates and a non-functional pre-order link. To resolve this, an apology email was crafted that:

- **Apologized directly** for the errors.  
- **Clarified** the correct launch date: **May 15**.  
- **Fixed** the pre-order link to ensure smooth access.  
- **Added value** by offering a 15% discount (Code: `INFINITY15`) for 24 hours.  

This approach restored confidence, encouraged pre-orders, and preserved the positive relationship with fans.

## Conclusion
Mistakes happen—but they can be turned into an opportunity for stronger engagement.  
By apologizing quickly and transparently while offering a goodwill gesture, Pixelated Games:

- Rebuilt customer trust.  
- Reinforced its credibility.  
- Converted a setback into a **brand loyalty win**.
