# **Project Title:** **Bath EcoShop – Brand Values Development Project**

---

## **Project Scenario**

Bath EcoShop is a new **eco-friendly bath products** e-commerce store launched by a home goods company. The company saw an opportunity in the market for sustainable and nature-inspired bath products that reflect environmental consciousness, trust, and long-term value.

To create an authentic brand identity, employees participated in a **branding exercise** using a FigJam board. They were asked:

> “If our brand were a person, how would you describe them?”

Their responses were written on **digital sticky notes**, which were later analyzed to identify common themes and define the **core brand values** of Bath EcoShop.

---

## **Project Objective**

The main objectives of this project were to:

1. **Identify five key brand values** that represent Bath EcoShop’s personality and purpose.
2. Determine **ways to demonstrate these values** through the company’s giving program and online content.
3. Align Bath EcoShop’s brand values with the **beliefs and expectations of its eco-conscious target audience**.

## **Step-by-Step Project Description**

### **Step 1 – Review the Scenario**

Bath EcoShop’s target audience was defined as individuals who:

* Care deeply about the **future of the environment**
* Prefer **dependable, long-lasting products**
* Value **comfort and function** over fleeting style
* Want to **feel good about their purchases**
* Appreciate **transparency, ethics, and sustainability**

These insights shaped the brand values and guided all later recommendations.

### **Step 2 – Create the FigJam Board**

A **FigJam board** was created to collect and organize team feedback about Bath EcoShop’s brand identity.
Each sticky note captured how people would describe the brand *if it were a person*.
Some examples included:

* “Someone you can depend on”
* “Acts with integrity”
* “Connected to the earth”
* “Inspired by nature”
* “Makes a difference in people’s lives”

These sticky notes were then grouped into similar themes that expressed Bath EcoShop’s key characteristics.
