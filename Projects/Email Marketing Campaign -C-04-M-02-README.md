When it comes to your pet’s health, it can be easy to overlook their teeth.  
Believe it or not, most cats and dogs begin to show signs of dental disease by the age of three.  
When plaque, tartar, and bacteria build up on the teeth, it can lead to pain, tooth loss, or serious infection.  
But with proper dental care, your furry friends can stay happy and healthy for years to come.

## Our Top Tips for Taking Care of Your Pet’s Teeth

1. **Brush your pet’s teeth**  
   Just like you, your dog or cat can benefit from regular tooth brushing.  
   It’s easiest to start brushing early, but even old dogs can learn this trick!

2. **Try tooth-cleaning toys, treats, or food**  
   If brushing isn’t an option, special toys, treats, or prescription food can be a good alternative.  
   We carry a number of products recommended by the Veterinary Oral Health Council.

3. **Schedule a professional cleaning**  
   The best way to maintain your pet’s oral health is a professional cleaning and exam.  
   Lakewood Pet Clinic offers comprehensive dental services.  
   Contact us today to schedule an appointment.
