# **Project Title:** **White Opal – Landing Page Optimization Using Heat Map Data**

---

### **Project Scenario:**

White Opal is a jewelry retailer with over 300 brick-and-mortar stores and an active e-commerce website. As part of its digital marketing strategy, the company aims to increase customer engagement and email signups through its landing page. The main function of this landing page is to help customers locate nearby stores, but the marketing team also wants to improve the number of visitors subscribing to the company’s email list.

### **Project Objective:**

To analyze customer engagement data using heat maps and provide data-driven recommendations that improve the landing page’s performance—specifically, to **increase email signups** while maintaining a positive user experience.

---

### **Project Description:**

Using scroll and click heat maps, customer interactions with the landing page were analyzed to identify patterns of engagement and areas needing improvement.
The scroll heat map revealed that most users did not reach the bottom of the page, while the click map indicated high activity near the store locator but low engagement with the email signup form.

Based on these insights, the following **recommendations** were made:

1. **Move the email signup form higher on the page** to improve visibility and increase conversions.
2. **Add a clear call-to-action (CTA)** near high-engagement elements like the store locator to capture user attention.
3. **Simplify the signup form** by reducing required fields, minimizing form fatigue.
4. **Offer a promotional incentive** such as a discount or exclusive content and use A/B testing to measure effectiveness.

These suggestions aim to make the signup process more visible, engaging, and user-friendly.
