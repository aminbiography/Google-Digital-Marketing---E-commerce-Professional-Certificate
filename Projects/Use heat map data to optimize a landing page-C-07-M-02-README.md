# **Project Title:** **White Opal – Landing Page Optimization Using Heat Map Data**

---

### **Project Scenario:**

White Opal is a jewelry retailer with over 300 brick-and-mortar stores and an active e-commerce website. As part of its digital marketing strategy, the company aims to increase customer engagement and email signups through its landing page. The main function of this landing page is to help customers locate nearby stores, but the marketing team also wants to improve the number of visitors subscribing to the company’s email list.

---

### **Project Objective:**

To analyze customer engagement data using heat maps and provide **data-driven recommendations** that improve the landing page’s performance — specifically, to **increase email signups** while maintaining a positive user experience.

---

### **Project Description:**

Using **scroll and click heat maps**, customer interactions with the landing page were analyzed to identify engagement patterns and areas needing improvement.

The **scroll heat map** revealed that most users did not reach the bottom of the page, while the **click heat map** showed high activity near the store locator but low engagement with the email signup form.

Based on these insights, the following **recommendations** were made:

1. **Move the email signup form higher on the page**

   * *Problem:* Most visitors aren’t scrolling far enough to find the form.
   * *Solution:* Move the form above the fold to increase visibility and conversions.

2. **Add a clear call-to-action (CTA) button near the store locator**

   * *Problem:* The click map shows high engagement around the store locator but few clicks in the signup area.
   * *Solution:* Add a “Sign up for exclusive offers” CTA near this high-traffic zone to capture attention and boost signups.

3. **Simplify the email signup form**

   * *Problem:* The form has multiple required fields, leading to user fatigue.
   * *Solution:* Reduce required fields to just name and email to make signup faster and easier.

4. **Test a promotional incentive for signing up**

   * *Problem:* Visitors may not see enough value in subscribing.
   * *Solution:* Offer a small reward—such as a discount or exclusive content—and run A/B tests to measure its impact on conversions.

These suggestions aim to make the signup process **more visible, engaging, and user-friendly**, while using data to guide design improvements.
