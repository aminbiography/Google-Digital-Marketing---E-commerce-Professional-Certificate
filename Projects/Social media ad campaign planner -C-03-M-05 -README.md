## Strategic Notes

- Formats were selected based on platform behavior:
  - **Facebook:** Static image ads perform well with targeted demographics and support direct CTA buttons like "Shop Now"
  - **Instagram:** Carousel engages better than static on visual-first platforms  
  - **X (Twitter):** Short, punchy static creatives align well with fast-scrolling behavior and highlight benefits quickly  
  - **YouTube:** Required use of **video** for effective ad placement  
  - **LinkedIn:** Informative post + static image appeals to professionals  
- Creatives addressed **persona’s goals and barriers**  
- CTA is consistent, simple, and conversion-oriented
