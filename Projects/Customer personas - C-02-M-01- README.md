## Bedding E-commerce Personas

This document defines two core customer personas to guide the development, marketing, and UX strategy of our online bedding store. By understanding the motivations, goals, and pain points of real users, we can create a more effective, inclusive, and conversion-focused shopping experience.

## Project Description

As our brand expands its bedding product line, it’s critical to align user experience and product offerings with the needs of our primary customer segments. Through research and user feedback, we’ve identified two target personas:

- **The Budget Buyer** – focused on affordability without sacrificing quality.
- **The Variety Shopper** – looking for customization and style, with high expectations for service and usability.

These personas will serve as a foundation for decision-making across design, marketing, and customer support initiatives.

## Persona 1 – The Budget Buyer

**Name:** Diego Martinez  
**Age:** 24  
**Location:** Suburbs  
**Household:** Lives alone  
**Education:** High school graduate  

### Goals
- Purchase **quality bedding** at an affordable price

### Barriers
- Concern about the **quality** of budget-friendly options
- Frustration with **unclear return policies** and refund processes

## Persona 2 – The Variety Shopper

**Name:** Malena Johnson  
**Age:** 44  
**Location:** City  
**Household:** Lives with one child  
**Education:** College graduate  

### Goals
- Discover the **ideal bedding** from a wide range of **colors, fabrics, and patterns**

### Barriers
- Struggles with a **cluttered or confusing website navigation**
- Worries about **shipping speed and delivery reliability**

---

## Conclusion

These personas represent two key user mindsets:

- Diego needs **affordable, trustworthy options** with clear policies and upfront value.
- Malena wants **customization and confidence** in both the product and shopping process.

By designing with Diego and Malena in mind, we can create a more intuitive, engaging, and satisfying customer experience that meets a diverse set of expectations — increasing loyalty, reducing friction, and boosting overall sales performance.

These personas should be revisited and updated as we gather more user data through testing, support tickets, and analytics.
