# **Project Title:** **E-Commerce Checkout Evaluation for Tee’s Shirts**

---

## **Project Scenario:**

Tee’s Shirts, an online T-shirt store, identified a high cart abandonment rate during checkout. Customers were leaving the process at key stages—sign-in, entering personal information, selecting shipping options, and entering payment details. As an e-commerce analyst, my role was to investigate why customers were abandoning their carts and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the checkout experience, reduce friction, and increase conversions.

## **Project Objective:**

To analyze Tee’s Shirts’ existing checkout process, identify the main pain points causing customer drop-offs, and propose practical solutions to improve the user experience and reduce cart abandonment rates.

---

## **Project Description:**

The checkout evaluation was conducted through a detailed review of the four main checkout stages. The following issues and solutions were identified:

### **Checkout Issue #1: Sign-in**

**Issue:** Customers were required to sign in or create an account, which led to frustration and abandonment.
**Solutions:**

* Enable **guest checkout** to allow purchases without account creation.
* Add **social sign-in options** (Google, Apple, Facebook) for faster access.
* Clearly explain the **benefits of account creation** such as faster checkout and order tracking.

---

### **Checkout Issue #2: Personal Information**

**Issue:** The form requested excessive details (multiple phone numbers, birthdate), creating privacy and effort concerns.
**Solutions:**

* Request only **essential fields** (name, address, email, one phone number).
* Make unnecessary fields **optional or remove them entirely**.
* Implement **auto-fill and address lookup** to streamline form completion.

---

### **Checkout Issue #3: Shipping**

**Issue:** Customers were discouraged by **high shipping costs** ($8–$15) and **long delivery times** (10–20 days).
**Solutions:**

* Offer **free shipping on orders over $25** to encourage higher-value purchases.
* Display **estimated delivery dates** instead of broad ranges.
* Show **shipping costs earlier** in the checkout flow to set expectations.

---

### **Checkout Issue #4: Payment**

**Issue:** Limited payment options and lack of visible security assurances caused hesitation.
**Solutions:**

* Add **multiple payment methods** such as PayPal, Google Pay, Apple Pay, and installment options.
* Display **security badges and SSL/TLS encryption icons** to reassure customers of data safety.
