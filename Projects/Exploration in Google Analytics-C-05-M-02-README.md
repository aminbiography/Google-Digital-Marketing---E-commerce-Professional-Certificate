## Presentation 2: Developer Events Analysis – July 2025

### Project Title  
Analysis of Developer Events Impact on Google Merchandise Store (July 2025)

### Objective

### Description  
Three developer events were analyzed:

- **Google for Startups Accelerator: AI First 2025 Class (Global)** – June 30, 2025  
- **Google Cloud Summit Nord (Düsseldorf)** – July 3, 2025  
- **Google I/O Connect India (Bengaluru)** – July 23, 2025  

Explorations in GA4 were used to detect anomalies in **Active Users** and **Purchases** ±1 day around the event dates.

**Findings:**
- **June 30 & July 3:** No anomalies detected.  
- **July 23:** Active Users anomaly detected on **July 22** (+21.4%, 4.5K actual vs. 3.5K expected). Purchases showed a slight uptick but no anomaly.
