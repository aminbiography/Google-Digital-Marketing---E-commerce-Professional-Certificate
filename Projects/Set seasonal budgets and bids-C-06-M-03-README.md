# **Project Title:** **Seasonal E-Commerce Budget and Bid Planning Using Google Ads**

---

## **Project Scenario:**

Personalized Presents is an e-commerce company that specializes in personalized gifts, decorations, and apparel. The company typically experiences a significant increase in sales during the U.S. holiday season (from Thanksgiving through New Year’s).

As an **E-commerce Analyst**, my goal was to use **Google Ads Performance Planner** data to determine the **optimal advertising budget** and **target ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)** for the holiday period.

Additionally, because revenue-per-click fluctuates dramatically during the holidays, I analyzed **last year’s performance data** to calculate **bid adjustments** for the upcoming season, ensuring maximum profitability and efficient ad performance.

---

## **Project Objective:**

The main objectives of this project were to:

1. Identify the **point of diminishing returns** in ad spend where profit peaks.
2. Determine the **recommended ad budget** and **target ROAS** for the holiday season.
3. Calculate **daily bid adjustments** based on projected changes in revenue-per-click.
4. Apply **data-driven insights** to optimize seasonal campaign performance.
5. Demonstrate the use of **Google Sheets** and **Performance Planner** in digital marketing decision-making.

## **Project Description & Steps:**

### **Part 1 – Budget Planning**

1. **Data Entry**
   I entered spend and revenue projection data into a Google Sheets template titled **“Holiday Budget and Bid Planning.”**

2. **ROAS Calculation**
   Formula used in column D (ROAS):

   ```
   =C4/B4
   ```

   This calculates the return on ad spend for each spend amount.

3. **Profit Calculation**
   Formula used in column E (Profit):

   ```
   =C4-B4
   ```

   This determines the projected profit for each spend level.

4. **Identify Point of Diminishing Returns**

   * The **highest profit** of **$16,000** occurs when **spend = $23,000**, **revenue = $39,000**, and **ROAS = 170%**.
   * This row was highlighted, and the point was labeled on the chart with a **red data point**.

5. **Record Recommended Budget & Target ROAS**

   * **Recommended Budget:** $23,000
   * **Target ROAS:** ~170%
     These values were recorded below the main table for clarity.

6. **Visualization**

   * A line chart titled **“Revenue vs. Spend”** was created.
   * The **red marker** on the chart clearly identifies the point of diminishing returns, matching the highlighted row in the table.

### **Part 2 – Bidding Calendar Planning**

1. **Analyze Last Year’s Data**
   I reviewed historical data to identify fluctuations in **revenue-per-click** during the holiday season.

2. **Calculate Bid Adjustments**
   Formula used:

   ```
   ((Projected Revenue-per-click - Typical Revenue-per-click) / Typical Revenue-per-click) × 100
   ```

   Example:
   If Typical = $4 and Projected = $7
   → ((7 − 4) / 4) × 100 = **75% increase**

3. **Add Adjustment Values**

   * Each group of days in the **Bidding Calendar tab** includes the corresponding **percentage adjustment**.
   * Notes were added beside each value: “Increase,” “Decrease,” or “No Change,” to indicate how bids should be adjusted relative to the previous year.

4. **Final Review**

   * All formulas were validated for accuracy.
   * The table formatting was improved for readability (bold headers, borders, and consistent numeric formatting).

## **Project Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates how strategic analysis and data modeling can enhance seasonal campaign planning.

Through systematic calculations, I identified the **optimal spend level ($23,000)** that delivers the **maximum profit ($16,000)** at a **target ROAS of approximately 170%**.

By applying performance insights from last year’s holiday season, I calculated bid adjustments to align ad investments with expected performance spikes — helping to **maximize conversions and profitability** during the high-demand holiday window.

Overall, the activity highlights my ability to leverage **Google Ads data, financial modeling, and seasonal forecasting** to create effective marketing strategies that balance spend and return.
