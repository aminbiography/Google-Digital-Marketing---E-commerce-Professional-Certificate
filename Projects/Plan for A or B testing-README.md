## **Conclusion**

This A/B testing plan provides Stay Hotel with a structured experiment to validate the effectiveness of a deals-focused headline. By comparing the original headline to a revised promotion-driven version, the campaign aims to boost conversions from 2% to 7%. If successful, this will demonstrate that aligning ad messaging with customer behavior insights (deal-seeking) can significantly improve campaign performance. **Results will be reviewed after 30 days to determine whether the revised headline should be adopted across campaigns.**
