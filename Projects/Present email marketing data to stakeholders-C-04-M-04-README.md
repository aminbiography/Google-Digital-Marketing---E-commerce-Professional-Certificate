## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to **increase summer season ticket sales by 10%** compared to the previous year through targeted marketing strategies. Email campaigns will play a key role by improving subscriber engagement—specifically **raising open rates and click-to-open rates (CTOR)** across three segments:

- **Recent attendees** (attended within the last 2 years)  
- **Past attendees** (attended 2+ years ago)  
- **Never attended** (email subscribers who have not yet been to a performance)  

By analyzing last year’s performance data, this project identifies which types of emails and promotions resonate most with each segment. The insights guide the content strategy for the new campaign to ensure emails are **more relevant, motivating, and effective** at driving ticket purchases.
