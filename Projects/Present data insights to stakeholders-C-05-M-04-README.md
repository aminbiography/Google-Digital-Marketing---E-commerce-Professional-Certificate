# Project Title: **L’Acier New-Account Growth: Data-Driven Dayparting Strategy**

## Project Scenario

L’Acier, an online cookware retailer, wants to **increase new customer account creations**. New accounts correlate with **higher purchase frequency and LTV**. The marketing team will run **additional ads with a one-time sign-up discount** and needs the **best times** (day/hour) to run them.

## Project Objective

Identify **when to run more vs. fewer ads** (by day and hour) to **maximize conversions**, **lower CPA**, and **support growth** via higher **LTV**.

## Project Description

* **Data & period:** Past month of site behavior and outcomes (Users, Sessions, Bounce Rate, Pages/Session, Avg. Session Duration, Conversion Rate, Conversions).
* **Methods:** Pivot tables; hour/day breakdowns; 8-slide visualization deck.
* **Key insights:** Sessions peak **~10:00–11:00**, but **conversion efficiency** is stronger **late morning through early evening**. **Average CVR ≈ 12.75%**; **Mon–Thu** above average; **Fri–Sun** at/below average. Best windows cluster **Mon–Wed 10:00–19:00 (often to ~21:00)**; **pre-6:00** underperforms across days.

## Speaker Notes

### Slide 4 - Weekly sessions by time of day

```
This chart shows total sessions by hour and day. Sessions are lowest overnight, climb from **6:00**, and **peak around 10:00–11:00**, then dip at noon and taper through the evening. Overall volume is highest **Wednesday–Friday** and lowest **Saturday**. If we considered sessions alone, **weekdays 10:00–12:00** might seem best for extra ads—but the **conversion** data tells a different story.
```

### Slide 5 - Total conversions by hour of day

```
This chart shows total conversions by hour, which broadly mirror sessions—low overnight, rising sharply in the morning, easing through evening. However, despite very high traffic at **10:00–11:00**, conversions aren’t disproportionately higher than at **13:00–15:00**, indicating efficiency varies by hour. **Conclusion:** Use **conversion rates**, not traffic alone, to choose ad windows.
```

### Slide 6 - Average conversion rates by day of week 

```
This chart compares each day’s **average conversion rate** to the weekly average (**12.75%**). **Monday–Thursday** are above average; **Friday** is around average; **Saturday–Sunday** are below. **Conclusion:** Prioritize **Mon–Thu** for increased ads, and **downweight Fri–Sun** unless specific hours prove strong.
```

### Slide 7 - Average & Mon–Wed conversion rates by hour 

```
The weekly hourly CVR rises after **8:00** and stays strong **~10:00–19:00**. The **Mon–Wed** lines follow this shape but show **peaks near 18–20%** (e.g., **Tue ~15:00**, **Mon ~21:00**) and lows before **6:00**. **Conclusion:** Increase bids **Mon–Wed 10:00–19:00** (extend to **~21:00** when performance holds); **downweight pre-6:00** across all days.
```

### Slide 8 - Conclusion & next steps 

```
We’ve identified **20 hours/week** to **increase** ad delivery and **22 hours/week** to **downweight**. This concentrates budget in **high-intent hours**, driving **more new-account conversions** at a **lower CPA** and supporting growth via higher **LTV**. **Next:** Enable dayparting (scale up **Mon–Thu late morning–evening**; downweight **overnights/weekend daytime**), run a **2-week pilot**, track **Conversions, CVR, CPA**, reinvest savings into top performers, and **review weekly** to refine time blocks and bids.

## Project Conclusion

**I have identified:**

* **20 hours** each week to **increase** ad delivery
* **22 hours** each week to **downweight**

**Why this matters:**

* Concentrates budget in **high-intent hours** → **more new-account conversions** and **lower CPA**
* Directly supports growth via accounts with **higher LTV**

## Next Steps

1. **Enable dayparting**: Scale up **Mon–Thu late morning–evening**; **downweight overnights** and **weekend daytime**.
2. Run a **2-week pilot**; track **Conversions, CVR, CPA**; **reinvest savings** into top-performing blocks.
3. **Review weekly**; refine time blocks/bids by device and geo.
