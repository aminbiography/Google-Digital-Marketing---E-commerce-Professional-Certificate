| **Negative comment** | Imani Moore     | What’s up with the hike in Great Grounds’ prices?! I used to be able to get my daily medium mocha for $4. Now it’s $4.25! That’s really going to add up over time . . . ​ | In response to a recent coffee shortage, Great Grounds has had to increase prices.  <br> Promotional code for half off one beverage: **HALFOFF** | Hi Imani, thanks so much for your feedback. We totally understand your concern. The price adjustment was a tough decision due to a recent coffee shortage.
