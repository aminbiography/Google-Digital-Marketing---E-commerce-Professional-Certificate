| Negative Comment      | Imani Moore       | _What’s up with the hike in Great Grounds’ prices?! I used to be able to get my daily medium mocha for $4. Now it’s $4.25! That’s really going to add up over time..._ | Due to a recent coffee shortage, prices have increased.  
Promo code for half off one beverage: **HALFOFF** | Hey Imani. We understand your frustration. Our suppliers have recently been facing a coffee shortage, and we have had to raise our prices a bit in order to continue to deliver you the premium beverages you’re used to getting at Great Grounds. To show you how much we appreciate customers like you, we’d like to offer you half off your next beverage. Use promotional code **HALFOFF** when you order online, or mention it when you order at any of our locations. Thank you for your understanding and continued business! |
