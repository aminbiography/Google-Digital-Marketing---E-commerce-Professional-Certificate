# SMART Goals for Email Marketing Campaign
*Feels Like Home – For All Product Line*

## Project Title
SMART Goals for the Email Marketing Campaign Launch of the *For All* Furniture Line

## Objective
The objective of this project is to design clear, measurable, and achievable email marketing goals that support the *For All* line’s primary business aim: **grow the total active customer base by 30% within one year of launch.**

By applying the SMART framework (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-bound), we ensure that our email marketing efforts are actionable and aligned with the company’s larger growth strategy.

## Goal One – Grow Email Subscriber List

**SMART Goal:**  
Increase the email subscriber list from **100,000 to 106,000 by September 30** by gaining **2,000 net-new subscribers per month** through referral discounts, social media, and paid media campaigns.

- **Specific:** Clear target (grow list by 6,000) with defined methods (referrals, social, paid).
- **Measurable:** Success = 106,000 subscribers tracked in the database.
- **Attainable:** Research + current growth (~1,000/month) + new campaigns make 2,000/month realistic.
- **Relevant:** Directly supports the *For All* launch and customer growth objective.
- **Time-bound:** Deadline set for **September 30** (three months after launch).

**SMART Goal:**  
Raise the **average monthly purchase conversion rate from 5% to 7%** within six months of launch (**by December 31**) by segmenting the email list for the *For All* line and optimizing welcome, newsletter, and promotional email series.

- **Specific:** Clear target (7% conversion rate) and methods (segmentation + optimized campaigns).
- **Measurable:** Tracked through monthly conversion rate metrics; success = 7%.
- **Attainable:** A 2% increase is realistic, supported by benchmarks and the new lower-priced product line.
- **Relevant:** Higher conversions directly support 30% growth goal.
- **Time-bound:** Must be achieved by **December 31** (six months post-launch).

## Conclusion
By rewriting the campaign objectives into SMART goals, the Feels Like Home marketing team has:

- Established **clear, trackable targets** for subscriber growth and conversion improvements.
- Ensured that goals are **realistic yet ambitious**, supported by market data and benchmarks.
- Aligned email marketing directly with the company’s **core business objective** of expanding its customer base by 30% in the first year of the *For All* product line.
