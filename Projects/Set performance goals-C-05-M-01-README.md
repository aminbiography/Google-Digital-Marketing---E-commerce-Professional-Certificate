**Performance Goals for Baba's Restaurant Q4 Email & Social Media
Campaigns**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Objective

To establish measurable, attainable, and relevant performance goals for
Baba's Restaurant's Q4 digital marketing campaigns (email and social
media), in alignment with the company's business goal of **increasing
annual revenue by 10% over 2020**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Description

Baba's Restaurant, an independently owned Gullah restaurant in South
Carolina, launched a proprietary spice blend line to expand revenue.
While initially sold only in-store, the company now aims to sell these
products through its website.

To support this initiative, targeted **email and social media marketing
campaigns** will drive website traffic and conversions. The campaigns
will be evaluated using **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** and **CVR
(Conversion Rate)** as KPIs, benchmarked against industry standards and
Baba's Q3 performance.

### Key Calculations (Q3 Performance):

-   **Email CVR:** (90 ÷ 1200) × 100 = **7.5%**\
-   **Email CTR:** (1200 ÷ 80,000) × 100 = **1.5%**\
-   **Social Media CVR:** (30 ÷ 900) × 100 = **3.3%**\
-   **Social Media CTR:** (900 ÷ 90,000) × 100 = **1.0%**

### Industry Benchmarks:

-   Email CVR = 8.3%, CTR = 2%\
-   Social CVR = 4%, CTR = 1.1%
