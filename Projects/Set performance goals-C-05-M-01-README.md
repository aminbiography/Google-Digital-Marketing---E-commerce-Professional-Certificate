**Performance Goals for Baba’s Restaurant Q4 Email & Social Media Campaigns**

---

## Project Objective  
To establish measurable, attainable, and relevant performance goals for Baba’s Restaurant’s Q4 digital marketing campaigns (email and social media). These goals are aligned with the company’s **business objective** of increasing annual revenue by **10% over 2020**.

## Project Description  
Baba’s Restaurant, an independently owned Gullah restaurant in South Carolina, recently launched a proprietary line of spice blends. Initially available only in-store, the company now plans to expand sales through its website.  

To support this expansion, targeted **email and social media campaigns** will be used to increase website traffic and conversions. Success will be measured using **CTR (Click-Through Rate)** and **CVR (Conversion Rate)**, compared against industry benchmarks and the restaurant’s Q3 performance.

### Q3 Performance (Calculated)  
- **Email CVR:** (90 ÷ 1200) × 100 = **7.5%**  
- **Email CTR:** (1200 ÷ 80,000) × 100 = **1.5%**  
- **Social Media CVR:** (30 ÷ 900) × 100 = **3.3%**  
- **Social Media CTR:** (900 ÷ 90,000) × 100 = **1.0%**

### Industry Benchmarks  
- Email → CVR: **8.3%**, CTR: **2%**  
- Social Media → CVR: **4%**, CTR: **1.1%**
