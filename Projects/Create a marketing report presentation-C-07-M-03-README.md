# **Project Title:** **End-of-Year Marketing Report - Sinclair Verde Lamp Company (2021)**

# **Project Scenario**

Good Mercury Marketing (my agency) completed its second year managing digital marketing for the Sinclair Verde Lamp Company. I was responsible for synthesizing Google Analytics and social data into a client-ready, 18-slide presentation that reviewed results, highlighted holiday season performance, and set up next-year recommendations.

# **Project Objective**

* Communicate progress against **three marketing goals**:

  1. Create brand awareness, 2) Drive visits to the physical store, 3) Increase online holiday sales by **3%**.
* Present clear, visualized performance for **website traffic** and **social media**.
* Compare **Holiday 2020 vs. Holiday 2021** using a simple “at-a-glance” table.
* Conclude with a concise outlook and actions for next year.

# **Project Description**

1. **Accessed template & assets**
   Opened the deck template; gathered the strategy doc and the 2021 Google Sheets analysis workbook (traffic, engagement, social).

3. **Chose a professional theme**
   Applied a clean theme that keeps charts readable and emphasizes data over decoration.

4. **Built the agenda (Slide 2)**
   Sections covered: The Goal • End-of-Year Overview • Holiday Season Report • Conclusion.
   (I optionally included brief sub-bullets for Website & Social metrics to orient the audience.)

5. **Stated the goals (Slides 3–4)**
   Reintroduced the three client goals from the strategy and tied them to the KPIs/metrics we would show (conversion, new customers, share rate, reach, link clicks).

6. **Website performance (Slides 5–9)**

   * **Total Traffic (2021):** Monthly trend lines for total and organic sessions.
   * **Pages per Visit:** Climbed from **2.5** (Jan) to **4.2** (Oct–Dec).
   * **Bounce Rate:** Improved from ~**36%** mid-year to **20%** in December.
   * **Average Visit Duration:** Grew from **1:12** to **2:24** by year end.
     These slides translate the analytics sheet into clear, single-focus charts with short takeaways.

7. **Social performance (Slides 10–14)**

   * **Social Media Mentions (Slide 10):** **500** mentions in **Jan 2021**; **660** in **Dec 2021**.
   * **Instagram Followers (Slide 11):** “Followers also increased. In 2021, the Sinclair Verde social page gained **9,000** followers.” *(Optional: If stating a percentage, ensure it’s consistent with the underlying totals in the sheet.)*
   * **Instagram Engagement (Slide 12):** **500** engagements in **Jan 2021**; **600** in **Dec 2021**; year-over-year line comparison included.
   * **Twitter Followers (Slide 13):** **4,000** in **Jan 2020**; **6,800** in **Dec 2021**.
   * **Twitter Engagement (Slide 14):** **500** in **Jan 2021**; **950** in **Dec 2021**.
     Each slide pairs one or two sentences of context with a comparison chart (2020 vs. 2021 when available).

8. **Holiday Season Report (Slides 15–16)**

   * Intro slide to frame the seasonal focus.
   * **Organic Performance Table (Slide 16):**

     |          | **November (Month 11)** | **December (Month 12)** | **Net Growth** |
     | -------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | -------------- |
     | **2020** | 145,000                 | 145,000                 | 0.00%          |
     | **2021** | 165,000                 | 170,000                 | 3.03%          |

     This standardized view helps the client see that Holiday 2021 outperformed Holiday 2020 and met the 3% sales lift target proxy through organic growth.

9. **Conclusion (Slides 17–18)**

   * Slide 17 introduces the section.
   * **Final slide copy (Slide 18):**
     *“In conclusion, the overall marketing data suggests strong and consistent growth across digital channels in 2021, reflecting improved engagement and brand visibility. Based on these trends, Good Mercury Marketing predicts continued gains next year, with emphasis on targeted social media campaigns and seasonal promotions to sustain momentum.”*
