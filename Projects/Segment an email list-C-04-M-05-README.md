# Feels Like Home - For All Email Segmentation

## Project Title
Email Segmentation for Targeted Marketing Campaigns

## Objective
To increase relevance, engagement, and conversion rates by segmenting email subscribers into targeted groups based on self-reported challenges, room interests, and promotional/event preferences.

## Description
This project applies **manual segmentation** rules to a subscriber dataset from *Feels Like Homeâ€™s For All* furniture line. Segmentation was performed using demographic and behavioral data collected at signup, such as:
- **Main challenge** when buying furniture
- **Room(s) of interest**
- Preference for **special promotions**
- Interest in **in-store events**

### Segmentation Rules
1. **Small Kitchen Solutions**  
   Subscribers with `Challenge = Small space` **AND** `Room interest = Kitchen/dining room`

2. **Exclusive In-store Sales**  
   Subscribers with `In-store events = Yes` **AND** `Special promotions = Yes`

3. **Pet-friendly Bedroom/Living Room Content**  
   Subscribers with `Challenge = Pet friendliness` **AND** `Room interest = Bedroom OR Living room/den`

### Results
- **Total subscribers:** 19
- **Small Kitchen Solutions:** 7 (Ava, Deonte, Emmett, Leona, Stefania, Penny, Min)
- **In-store Sales:** 11 (Felix, Rosa, Deonte, Casey, Tarit, Leona, Shirin, Ahmet, Min, Riley, Kenji)
- **Pet-friendly Content:** 9 (Felix, Jaya, Rosa, Casey, Saanvi, Quinn, Hector, Shirin, Ahmet)
- **Overlap (two or more segments):** 8 (Felix, Rosa, Deonte, Casey, Leona, Shirin, Ahmet, Min)

## Conclusion
Segmentation ensures each subscriber receives the **most relevant content**:
- Space-conscious buyers get tips and discounts on **small kitchen furniture**.  
- Deal-seekers who want in-person shopping receive **exclusive sale invites**.  
- Pet owners interested in bedrooms/living rooms get **furniture care content**.  

This tailored approach will help build stronger brand loyalty and drive sales.
