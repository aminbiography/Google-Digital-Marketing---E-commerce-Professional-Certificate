# Project Title  
**Review and Apply Google Ads Recommendations**  

---

## Project Objective  
The objective of this project is to analyze Google Ads recommendations for a Search ad campaign, evaluate their predicted impact, and decide whether to apply, plan, or dismiss each recommendation. The reasoning behind each decision and next steps (if applicable) are documented to ensure alignment with campaign goals and company practices.

## Project Scenario  
You are managing a **Google Search ad campaign** with the primary business goal of **maximizing sales (conversions) from new customers**. The **Conversion column** in Google Ads measures new customer sales and informs your bidding strategy, which currently relies on **Target CPA**.  

- **Budget is flexible**, but any increases require **executive approval**.  
- You are responsible for campaign management and must follow best practices for budget adjustments.  
- Since the campaign goal is conversions (not conversion value), the **Conversion Value column** is not required for bidding.

## Project Presentation  

### Reviewed Recommendations and Decisions  

| Recommendation | Predicted Impact | Decision | Reason | Next Steps |
|----------------|------------------|----------|--------|------------|
| Some ad groups do not have ads. | Get ads running by adding ads to each ad group. | **A (Apply)** | A repair recommendation; without ads, ad groups cannot deliver results. Immediate improvement to optimization score. | None |
| Bid more efficiently with Maximize Conversion Value. | More conversion value at similar ROAS. | **D (Dismiss)** | Business goal is new customer conversions, not value. Current Target CPA aligns better. | None |
| Bid more efficiently with Maximize Conversions using a Target CPA. | More conversions at same/lower CPA with automated bidding. | **P (Plan)** | Already using Target CPA. Automation may improve results but requires testing. | Run A/B test comparing manual vs. automated CPA bidding. Ensure conversion tracking is accurate. |
| Add sitelinks to your ads. | Ads become more prominent and clickable. | **A (Apply)** | Easy to implement, improves CTR, no budget/strategy risks. | None |
| Use optimized ad rotation. | Automatically show best ads at auction time. | **A (Apply)** | Improves performance with low risk; allows Google to prioritize top-performing ads. | None |
| Raise your budget. | Prevent ads from stopping on busiest days. | **P (Plan)** | Could improve sales, but budget increases require executive approval. | Prepare performance report showing lost impressions/conversions. Request approval from executives. |

## Conclusion  
The review of six Google Ads recommendations resulted in:  
- **3 recommendations applied immediately** (repairs and quick wins).  
- **2 recommendations planned for later** (strategic changes requiring testing or approval).  
- **1 recommendation dismissed** (not aligned with current campaign goals).  

This structured decision-making ensures campaign performance is optimized while respecting business priorities and processes.
