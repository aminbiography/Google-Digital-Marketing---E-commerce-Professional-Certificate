# **Project Title:** **Google Sheets Data Visualization — Analyzing Conversion Rates by Time and Day**

---

## **Project Scenario:**

A digital analytics team wanted to understand how **conversion rates** varied across different **days of the week** and **hours of the day** using website performance data.
The dataset contained fields such as:

* Day of Week
* Hour of Day
* Users
* Sessions
* Bounce Rate
* Pages/Session
* Average Session Duration
* Conversion Rate
* Conversions

The objective was to visualize patterns in user behavior to identify the **most effective times for conversions**, supporting marketing strategy optimization.

## **Project Description:**

### **Step 1: Importing and Preparing the Dataset**

* Imported the dataset into **Google Sheets**.
* Verified data structure and column types (Day, Hour, Metrics).
* Removed duplicates and ensured time fields were formatted properly.

---

### **Step 2: Visualizing Sessions by Day of Week**

* Created a **stacked column chart** to show total Sessions per Day of Week.
* Used `Day of Week` for X-axis and `Sessions` for Y-axis.
* This revealed peak activity around weekends.

### **Step 3: Average Conversion Rate by Day of Week**

* Summarized the dataset to compute average Conversion Rate for each day.
* Built a **column chart** titled *“Average Conversion Rate by Day of Week.”*
* Found higher rates mid-week compared to weekends.

---

### **Step 4: Average Conversion Rate by Hour of Day**

* Aggregated all days to analyze hourly trends.
* Added a **line chart** using “Hour of Day” vs. “Conversion Rate.”
* Identified conversion peaks around mid-morning and late evening.

---

### **Step 5: Monday–Wednesday Conversion Rate by Hour of Day**

* Filtered data to **Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday** only.
* Plotted a **line chart** comparing conversion rates across these weekdays.
* The chart highlighted consistent morning-hour spikes and steady midday performance.

## **Project Conclusion:**

* **Conversion rates** vary notably by both **time of day** and **day of week**.
* **Midweek mornings (Mon–Wed, 9 AM–11 AM)** show the highest efficiency in conversions.
* **Session volume** peaks on weekends but with slightly lower conversion efficiency.
* The project demonstrates the power of **Google Sheets charts** (bar, stacked, and line) for discovering actionable marketing insights quickly.
