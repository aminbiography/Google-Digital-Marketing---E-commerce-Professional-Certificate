# Project Title  
**20% Off Promotion – Bedding Campaign for Urban Moms**

---

## Description  
This promotional campaign is tailored to increase conversions by addressing a key audience's shopping frustrations—specifically, women around 44 years old, living in cities, with two kids, who are college-educated and have an interest in shopping and home improvement.

The focus is on solving a major user pain point: ineffective filtering tools when searching for specific bedding styles online. By offering **an improved shopping experience, live chat support, and a 20% discount**, the campaign seeks to turn browsing into buying across various digital platforms. Each platform leverages unique ad formats and creative approaches that resonate with both the audience and the channel’s strengths.
