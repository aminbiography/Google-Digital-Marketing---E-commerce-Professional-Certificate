# Social Media Data Analysis

## Project Description
This project analyzes the performance of two social media posts to assess what factors most influence audience engagement. The goal is to draw actionable insights to improve future content strategy based on key performance metrics, post content, and timing.

| **Task** | **Response** |
|---------|--------------|
| **1. Compare the posts’ data.** | Post 1 had 211,574 impressions and 329 engagements. Post 2 had significantly fewer impressions (117,261) but much higher engagements (1,913). Post 2 also had higher reposts (37 vs 21), replies (29 vs 14), likes (487 vs 244), user profile clicks (152 vs 71), hashtag clicks (31 vs 0), and detail expands (1,214 vs 0).<br><br>**Conclusion:** Even though Post 1 had more impressions, Post 2 clearly performed better in terms of engagement, which was the campaign’s primary goal. |
| **2. Compare the posts’ content and details.** | **Post 1:** No image, factual tone, no hashtags, posted at 8:03 AM.<br><br>**Post 2:** Included a humorous and relatable image of a person half-asleep while pouring coffee, matched with a casual, witty caption. Used relevant hashtags (#DaylightSavings #CoffeeTime). Posted at 1:59 AM—right before people would set clocks forward.<br><br>**Conclusion:** Post 2 had more engaging and emotionally resonant content (image + tone), hashtags for discoverability, and was timed more strategically. These factors likely drove higher engagement. |
| **3. Analyze the differences in the posts’ performance.** | Although Post 1 had more impressions, its lack of hashtags, visual content, and engaging language likely made it less compelling.<br><br>Post 2, with its relatable and humorous message, hashtags, and visual asset, encouraged more interaction. Its timing—posted just before the clocks changed—may have made it feel more relevant and timely. These elements likely contributed to its higher engagement despite fewer impressions. |
| **4. Explain how your analysis will inform your strategy.** | Going forward, I’ll focus on crafting more engaging, relatable copy using a casual tone and humor when appropriate. I’ll incorporate relevant hashtags to increase discoverability and always include eye-catching visuals when possible. Posting closer to relevant events or moments can also boost relevance and engagement. Finally, I’ll prioritize engagement-focused metrics when evaluating post success, not just impressions. |

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights the critical role that content style, visuals, hashtags, and timing play in social media performance. Engagement is driven more by how the audience connects with a post than by how many people see it. These insights will guide a more strategic, engagement-focused approach to future social media campaigns.
