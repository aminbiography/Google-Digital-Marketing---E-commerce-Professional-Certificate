## **Project Scenario**  
I am a Digital Marketing & E-commerce Analyst who just completed work on a multi-channel advertising campaign for an e-commerce business. The campaign included search ads, display ads, social ads, and shopping ads. As part of the project debriefing, I was responsible for calculating and presenting the campaign’s ROI to help guide future advertising budget decisions.

## Customer Insights  
- Shopping ads attract the **highest % of new customers** (23.16%).  
- Social ads drive strong ROI but **low new customer % (13.51%)**.  
- Search ads generate high AOV but fail efficiency benchmarks.  

---

## Recommendations  
1. **Reallocate 10–15% (~$25K) from Search & Display → Social & Shopping.**  
2. **Strategically deprioritize** channels with LTV:CAC < 2 until optimized.  
3. **Optimize landing pages** for Social (13.5%) & Display (17.5%) to improve conversion.  
   - Message alignment  
   - Simplified purchase flow  
   - Trust signals  
   - Personalized offers  
   - Mobile UX improvements  
4. **Test cross-channel strategies** (e.g., retarget Search visitors via Social).  

---

## Conclusion  
By reallocating budgets and improving conversion funnels, Social and Shopping ads can **scale profitably**, while Search and Display require **testing and optimization**. These insights will directly influence **future ad spend efficiency** and **sustainable growth**.
