# **Project Title**  
ROI Analysis for Multi-Channel E-Commerce Ad Campaign  

---

## **Project Scenario**  
I am a Digital Marketing & E-commerce Analyst who just completed work on a multi-channel advertising campaign for an e-commerce business. The campaign included search ads, display ads, social ads, and shopping ads. As part of the project debriefing, I was responsible for calculating and presenting the campaign’s ROI to help guide future advertising budget decisions.

## **Project Objective**  
My objectives in this project were to:  
1. Calculate and analyze **ROI using ROAS and LTV** for each campaign channel.  
2. Evaluate **LTV to CAC ratios** and **customer purchase percentages**.  
3. Provide **data-driven recommendations** for future budget allocation.  
4. Identify **conversion improvement opportunities** through landing page optimization.

## **Project Description**  
I carried out the analysis using the following steps:  

- **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend):** Measured as *Revenue ÷ Ad spend*. Social ads (ROAS 4.67) and Shopping ads (ROAS 3.55) were the strongest performers. Search ads (ROAS 1.71) and Display ads (ROAS 1.76) underperformed.  

- **AOV (Average Order Value):** Measured as *Revenue ÷ Orders*. Search ads had the highest AOV ($128.69), while Display ads had the lowest ($27.60).  

- **LTV (Customer Lifetime Value):** Calculated as *AOV × Purchase frequency*. Search ads ($193.04) had the highest LTV, while Display ads ($55.20) had the lowest.  

- **LTV to CAC Ratios:** Calculated as *LTV ÷ CAC*. Social ads (4.68) and Shopping ads (3.66) exceeded the profitability benchmark of 3. Search (1.72) and Display (1.78) fell below 2, indicating inefficiency.  

- **Percentage of New Customers Making Purchases:** Social ads had the lowest percentage (13.51%), while Shopping ads had the highest (23.16%).  

- **Budget Recommendations:**  
  - Reallocate 10–15% (~$25K) of budget from Search and Display into Social and Shopping.  
  - Pause or reduce investment in channels with LTV:CAC <2 until optimized.  
  - Scale profitable growth by increasing spend on Social and Shopping ads.  

- **Landing Page Customization Recommendations:**  
  - Focus on **Social ads** (13.5%) and **Display ads** (17.5%) to improve conversion rates.  
  - Test: tighter message alignment, simplified purchase flow, trust signals, personalized offers, and mobile performance.

## **Project Conclusion**  
The analysis showed that Social and Shopping ads are the most profitable channels, while Search and Display require optimization. By reallocating budget and improving landing pages, I can enhance ROI and drive sustainable growth. These findings will directly influence how future budgets are spent and how campaigns are optimized for efficiency and profitability.
