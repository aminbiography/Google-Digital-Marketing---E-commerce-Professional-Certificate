# Marketing Analytics & Testing

## 1. What is ROI in marketing and how is it calculated?
- **Definition:** Return on Investment (ROI) measures the profit generated relative to the cost of a marketing campaign.  
- **Formula (Method 1):**
  ```
  ROI = (Sales Growth – Marketing Cost) / Marketing Cost
  ```
  **Example:** Sales growth = $200,000, Marketing cost = $55,000 →  
  ROI = (200,000 – 55,000) ÷ 55,000 = **2.6**  
  - ROI > 1 = profitable; ROI = 1 = break-even.  

- **Formula (Method 2 using LTV):**  
  ROI can also be measured by monitoring **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** trends.  
  An **increasing LTV** signals improved ROI.

## 2. What is ROAS and how is it calculated?
- **Definition:** Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) measures the revenue earned for every dollar spent on advertising.  
- **Formula:**
  ```
  ROAS = Revenue / Ad Spend
  ```
- **Example:** A 5:1 ROAS goal means $5 revenue per $1 spent.  
- **Best practices:**  
  - Evaluate after **50 conversions** (to reduce noise).  
  - Set **per-channel goals** (e.g., 3:1 for search, 4:1 for display).  
  - Adjust bidding if ROAS is below target.

## 3. What is LTV and how is it used in ROI measurement?
- **Definition:** Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) = average revenue per customer over time.  
- **Formula (Basic):**
  ```
  LTV = Average Order Value (AOV) × Purchase Frequency
  ```
- **Types of LTV:**  
  - **Total LTV:** Past → Present.  
  - **Predicted LTV (pLTV):** Forecast future value.  

- **Benchmark ratio:**
  ```
  LTV:CAC = LTV ÷ CAC
  ```
  - ≥2 = acceptable, ≈3 = ideal, <2 = acquisition too costly.  

---

## 4. What is CAC and how is it calculated?
- **Definition:** Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) = average cost of gaining one paying customer.  
- **Formula:**
  ```
  CAC = (Total Marketing + Sales Costs) / Number of New Customers
  ```
- **Use case:** Commonly paired with LTV in the **LTV:CAC ratio**.  

---

## 5. What is Lifetime ROAS and how is it measured?
- **Definition:** Combines ROAS with LTV for long-term impact.  
- **Formula:**
  ```
  Lifetime ROAS = (Number of New Customers × Total LTV) / Ad Spend
  ```

## 6. What are the different testing methods in digital marketing?
- **A/B Testing (Split/Bucket Test):**  
  - Compares two variants with one differing element.  
  - Users split 50/50.  
  - Example: Headline A vs. Headline B in Google Ads.  

- **Redirect Testing:**  
  - Compares two different pages/URLs.  
  - Useful for **complete redesigns**.  

- **Multivariate Testing:**  
  - Tests multiple elements (e.g., CTA + headline + image).  
  - Finds best **individual elements** and **combinations**.  

---

## 7. What statistical terms are important in A/B testing?
- **Statistical significance:** Shows if results are real or random.  
- **Confidence level:** Probability results remain valid (95% common).  
- **Confidence interval:** Range of possible results with margin of error.  
- **Margin of error:** Gap between sample and theoretical true results.  

---

## 8. What are micro-conversions and macro-conversions?
- **Micro-conversion:** Early step toward purchase (e.g., email signup).  
- **Macro-conversion:** Final goal, like a purchase.  

**Example:**  
- Email sign-ups ↑ 21% (micro), purchases flat (macro).  
- Chatbot met both goals.  
- Blog visits missed both.

## 9. Case study: How Good Boy Studios improved customer acquisition
- **Company:** Good Boy Studios, PetStar™ app.  
- **Challenge:** Users dropped off at Event 6 (mouth markers) and Event 8 (video recording).  
- **Solutions with A/B tests:**  
  - **User tips:**  
    - Variant A (“pinch to zoom”) → +44% completion.  
    - Variant B (“mouth closed”) → +25% completion.  
  - **Recording Song indicator:** Raised completion from **62% → 67%**, iOS at 70%.  
- **Result:** Higher video completions, more premium subscriptions.

## 10. How do you plan an A/B test?
- **Steps:**  
  1. Define problem/goal.  
  2. Form hypothesis (problem, change, expected result).  
  3. Create variants (A = control, B = change).  
  4. Select metrics (primary + secondary).  
  5. Define success (e.g., +15% CTR).  
  6. Choose sample size, duration, confidence.  
  7. Run test, measure, analyze results.
