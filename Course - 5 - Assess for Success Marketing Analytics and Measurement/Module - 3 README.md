# Marketing Analytics & Testing

---

### **1. Return on Investment (ROI)**

*Measures profit relative to marketing cost.*

$$
ROI = \frac{(Sales\ Growth - Marketing\ Cost)}{Marketing\ Cost}
$$

**Example:** Sales growth = $200,000, Cost = $55,000

$$
ROI = \frac{200,000 - 55,000}{55,000} = 2.6
$$

ROI > 1 = profitable; ROI = 1 = break-even.

---

### **2. Return on Ad Spend (ROAS)**

*Measures revenue earned per $1 of ad spend.*

$$
ROAS = \frac{Revenue}{Ad\ Spend}
$$

**Example:** Revenue = $50,000, Ad Spend = $10,000

$$
ROAS = \frac{50,000}{10,000} = 5
$$

$5 revenue for every $1 spent.

---

### **3. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)**

*Average revenue per customer over time.*

$$
LTV = \frac{Total\ Revenue}{Number\ of\ Customers}
$$

*Or:*

$$
LTV = Average\ Order\ Value \times Purchase\ Frequency
$$

**Example:** AOV = $100, Frequency = 5

$$
LTV = 100 \times 5 = 500
$$

---

### **4. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**

*Average cost to acquire one paying customer.*

$$
CAC = \frac{Total\ Marketing + Sales\ Costs}{New\ Customers\ Acquired}
$$

**Example:** Costs = $30,000, Customers = 600

$$
CAC = \frac{30,000}{600} = 50
$$

$50 per customer.

---

### **5. LTV : CAC Ratio**

*Key efficiency metric.*

$$
LTV:CAC = \frac{LTV}{CAC}
$$

**Example:** LTV = 500, CAC = 50

$$
LTV:CAC = \frac{500}{50} = 10
$$

≥2 good, ≈3 ideal, <2 inefficient.

---

### **6. Lifetime ROAS**

*Long-term ad efficiency combining ROAS + LTV.*

$$
Lifetime\ ROAS = \frac{New\ Customers \times Total\ LTV}{Ad\ Spend}
$$

**Example:** 1,000 customers × $500 LTV, Spend = $100,000

$$
Lifetime\ ROAS = \frac{1,000 \times 500}{100,000} = 5
$$

$5 lifetime revenue per $1 spent.

---

### **7. Testing Methods**

* **A/B Test:**
  Two variants, split traffic 50/50. Measures one change at a time.
  *Example: Email headline A vs B.*

* **Redirect Test:**
  Compares different URLs (e.g., two landing pages).
  *Example: Old checkout page vs redesigned checkout.*

* **Multivariate Test:**
  Tests multiple elements simultaneously (CTA + image + headline).
  *Example: Which combo converts best?*

---

### **8. Key Statistical Terms**

* **Statistical significance** → not random chance.
* **Confidence level** → 95% standard.
* **Confidence interval** → value range including margin of error.
* **Margin of error** → gap between sample vs. true population.

---

### **9. Conversion Types**

* **Micro-conversion** → early steps (email sign-up, chatbot).
* **Macro-conversion** → final purchase.

Example: Email sign-ups ↑ 21% (micro) but purchases flat (macro).

---

### **10. Case Study Snapshot - Good Boy Studios**

* **Problem:** Drop-offs at mouth marker setup & recording stage.
* **Solution:**

  * A/B tips → +44% & +25% completion.
  * “Recording Song” indicator → raised completion from 62% → 67% (70% iOS).
* **Result:** Higher video completions → more premium conversions.

# Marketing Analytics & Testing

### **1. What is ROI in marketing and how is it calculated?**

* **Definition:** Return on Investment (ROI) measures the profit generated relative to the cost of a marketing campaign.

* **Formula (Method 1):**

$$
ROI = \frac{(Sales\ Growth - Marketing\ Cost)}{Marketing\ Cost}
$$

**Example:** Sales growth = $200,000, Marketing cost = $55,000

$$
ROI = \frac{200,000 - 55,000}{55,000} = 2.6
$$

ROI > 1 = profitable; ROI = 1 = break-even.

* **Formula (Method 2 using LTV):**
  ROI can also be tracked by **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** trends. An **increasing LTV** signals improved ROI.

---

### **2. What is ROAS and how is it calculated?**

* **Definition:** Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) measures the revenue earned for every dollar spent on advertising.

* **Formula:**

$$
ROAS = \frac{Revenue}{Ad\ Spend}
$$

**Example:** Revenue = $50,000, Ad Spend = $10,000

$$
ROAS = \frac{50,000}{10,000} = 5
$$

$5 revenue for every $1 spent.

* **Best practices:**

  * Evaluate after **50 conversions**.
  * Split targets by **product groups**.
  * Adjust bidding if ROAS < goal.

---

### **3. What is LTV and how is it used in ROI measurement?**

* **Definition:** Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) is the **average revenue per customer** over time.

* **Formula (Basic):**

$$
LTV = \frac{Total\ Revenue}{Number\ of\ Customers}
$$

*Or:*

$$
LTV = Average\ Order\ Value \times Purchase\ Frequency
$$

**Example:** AOV = $100, Frequency = 5

$$
LTV = 100 \times 5 = 500
$$

* **Key metric:**

$$
LTV:CAC\ Ratio = \frac{LTV}{CAC}
$$

≥2 good, ≈3 ideal, <2 inefficient.

---

### **4. What is CAC and how is it calculated?**

* **Definition:** Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) = average cost to acquire one paying customer.

* **Formula:**

$$
CAC = \frac{Total\ Marketing + Sales\ Costs}{New\ Customers\ Acquired}
$$

**Example:** Costs = $30,000, Customers = 600

$$
CAC = \frac{30,000}{600} = 50
$$

$50 per new customer.

---

### **5. What is Lifetime ROAS and how is it measured?**

* **Definition:** Combines ROAS with LTV for **long-term ad efficiency**.

* **Formula:**

$$
Lifetime\ ROAS = \frac{New\ Customers \times Total\ LTV}{Ad\ Spend}
$$

**Example:** 1,000 customers × $500 LTV, Spend = $100,000

$$
Lifetime\ ROAS = \frac{1,000 \times 500}{100,000} = 5
$$

$5 lifetime revenue per $1 spent.

---

### **6. What are the different testing methods in digital marketing?**

* **A/B Test:** Two variants, one change, split 50/50.
  *Example: Email headline A vs B.*

* **Redirect Test:** Different URLs, e.g., old vs redesigned landing page.

* **Multivariate Test:** Multiple variables (CTA + image + headline). Identifies best **combination**.

---

### **7. What statistical terms are important in A/B testing?**

* **Statistical significance** → not random chance.
* **Confidence level** → 95% standard.
* **Confidence interval** → possible value range.
* **Margin of error** → gap between sample vs. population.

---

### **8. What are micro-conversions and macro-conversions?**

* **Micro-conversion:** Early actions (email signup, chatbot).
* **Macro-conversion:** Final action (purchase).

Example: Email sign-ups ↑ 21% (micro), but purchases stayed flat (macro).

---

### **9. Can you give a case study example of using A/B testing and analytics?**

**Good Boy Studios (PetStar App):**

* **Problem:** Drop-offs at mouth marker setup (Event 6) & recording (Event 8).
* **Solution:**

  * Variant A tip (“pinch to zoom”) → +44% completion.
  * Variant B tip (“mouth closed”) → +25% completion.
  * “Recording Song” indicator → raised completion 62% → 67% (70% iOS).
* **Result:** Higher completions → more premium conversions.

---

### **10. How do you plan an A/B test?**

1. Define goal.
2. Form hypothesis.
3. Create variants (A = control, B = change).
4. Pick metrics (primary + secondary).
5. Set success definition.
6. Decide sample size, duration, confidence level.
7. Run, measure, analyze.
