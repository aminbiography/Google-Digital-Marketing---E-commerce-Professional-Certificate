# Marketing Analytics & Testing

---

### 1. What is ROI in marketing and how is it calculated?
**Definition:** Return on Investment (ROI) measures the profit generated relative to the cost of a marketing campaign.  

**Formula (Method 1):**
```
ROI = (Sales Growth – Marketing Cost) / Marketing Cost
```
**Example:**  
- Sales growth = $200,000  
- Marketing cost = $55,000  
- ROI = (200,000 – 55,000) ÷ 55,000 = **2.6**  

ROI > 1 = profitable; ROI = 1 = break-even.  

**Formula (Method 2 using LTV):**  
ROI can also be measured by monitoring **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** trends.  
An **increasing LTV** indicates improved ROI.

### 2. What is ROAS and how is it calculated?
**Definition:** Return on Ad Spend (ROAS) measures the revenue earned for every dollar spent on advertising.  

**Formula:**
```
ROAS = Revenue / Ad Spend
```

**Example:**  
- Goal of 5:1 ROAS → $5 revenue per $1 spent.  
- Per-channel goals: **3:1 for search ads**, **4:1 for display ads**.  

**Best practices:**
- Evaluate after **50 conversions**.  
- Split ROAS targets by **product groups**.  
- Adjust **bidding strategies** if ROAS is below target.

### 3. What is LTV and how is it used in ROI measurement?
**Definition:** Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) is the **average revenue per customer** over a time period.  

**Formula:**
```
LTV = Average Order Value (AOV) × Purchase Frequency
```

**Types of LTV:**
- **Total LTV:** Past → Present.  
- **Predicted LTV (pLTV):** Future estimate.  

**Key Metric (LTV:CAC ratio):**
```
LTV:CAC = LTV ÷ CAC
```
- ≥2 is good  
- ≈3 is ideal  
- <2 = high acquisition costs  

---

### 4. What is CAC and how is it calculated?
**Definition:** Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) is the average cost of acquiring one paying customer.  

**Formula:**
```
CAC = (Total Marketing + Sales Costs) / Number of New Customers Acquired
```

---

### 5. What is Lifetime ROAS and how is it measured?
**Definition:** Combines ROAS with LTV to measure long-term performance.  

**Formula:**
```
Lifetime ROAS = (Number of New Customers × Total LTV) / Ad Spend
```

---

### 6. What are the different testing methods in digital marketing?
- **A/B Testing (Split/Bucket):** Compares 2 versions with 1 differing element. Users split 50/50.  
- **Redirect Testing:** Compares 2 different URLs/pages. Best for redesigns.  
- **Multivariate Testing:** Tests multiple elements (e.g., CTA + image + headline) at once.  

---

### 7. What statistical terms are important in A/B testing?
- **Statistical significance:** Was the result real or chance?  
- **Confidence level:** Reliability (95% is standard).  
- **Confidence interval:** Range of results accounting for error.  
- **Margin of error:** Difference between test and theoretical result.  

---

### 8. What are micro-conversions and macro-conversions?
- **Micro-conversion:** Small steps (e.g., email signup, chatbot).  
- **Macro-conversion:** Final purchase.  

**Example:**  
- Email sign-ups ↑ 21% (micro), purchases flat (macro).  
- Chatbot hit both targets.  
- Blog visits missed both.  

---

### 9. Case study: Good Boy Studios (PetStar App)
- **Challenge:** Drop-offs at Event 6 (mouth markers) & Event 8 (recording).  
- **Solution (A/B tests):**
  - Variant A (“pinch to zoom”) → +44% completion.  
  - Variant B (“mouth closed”) → +25% completion.  
  - Added **RECORDING SONG indicator** → completion ↑ from 62% → 67% (70% iOS).  
- **Result:** Higher completion & premium conversions.  

---

### 10. How do you plan an A/B test?
1. Define problem/goal.  
2. Form hypothesis (problem, change, expected outcome).  
3. Create variants (A = control, B = one change).  
4. Decide metrics.  
5. Define success (e.g., +15% CTR).  
6. Choose sample size, duration, confidence level.  
7. Run, measure, analyze.
