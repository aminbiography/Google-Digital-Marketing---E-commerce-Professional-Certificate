# Marketing Analytics & Measurement**

---

## **1. Data Analysis in Spreadsheets**

**Purpose:** Organize, sort, and filter data to reveal insights.

### Key Tools:

* **Sorting:** Arrange data alphabetically or numerically (A–Z or Z–A).
* **Filtering:** Display only specific data that meets certain conditions.

### Example Calculations:

* **Percentage of campaign purchases:**

$$
\text{Percentage} = \frac{\text{Campaign Purchases}}{\text{Total Purchases}} \times 100
$$

**Insight Example:**
“2.66% of all purchases resulted from Campaign EZ3043.”

---

## **2. Pivot Tables**

**Purpose:** Summarize and categorize data quickly for insights.

### Key Steps:

* Select data → *Insert* → *Pivot Table* → *New Sheet*
* **Rows:** Category (e.g., Store, State)
* **Columns:** Campaign or Code
* **Values:** Sum, Average, or COUNTA
* **Filters:** Optional for focusing on specific campaigns or groups

### Example Calculations:

* **Percentage of campaign purchases:**

$$
\text{=C52/563}
$$

(where C52 is the total purchases for that campaign)

**Insight Example:**

* 4.97% from Campaign 39343E
* 2.84% from Campaign CGRWAT
* 2.66% from Campaign EZ3043

## **3. Data Visualization in Spreadsheets**

**Purpose:** Turn data into easy-to-read visuals for quick insights.

### Chart Types:

| Chart Type               | Use Case                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Column / Bar**         | Compare quantities across categories             |
| **Stacked Column / Bar** | Show composition within total values             |
| **Line Chart**           | Show trends over time                            |
| **Area Chart**           | Show volume change (filled line chart)           |
| **Pie Chart**            | Show parts of a whole (100%)                     |
| **Histogram**            | Show frequency distribution (e.g., ages, ranges) |

### Example:

Comparing **new users vs total users** per browser using a stacked column chart.

## **4. Chart Design & Accessibility**

**Purpose:** Create clear, inclusive visuals that everyone can interpret.

### Best Practices:

* Use **high-contrast colors** and **large fonts**.
* Add **labels**, not just legends.
* Use **patterns**, not color alone, to differentiate data.
* Add **alt text** for visuals and **captions** for videos.
* Avoid clutter; leave **white space** and emphasize key data.

---

## **5. Choosing the Right Chart**

**Avoid crowded visuals:**

* **Group by regions** (e.g., Northeast, South, West) instead of 50 states.
* **Combine minor categories** (e.g., “All other states <3%”) in pie charts.

### Key Takeaway:

Choose the simplest chart that tells the story clearly — fewer elements often mean more clarity.

---

## **6. Advanced Analysis Tools**

**When spreadsheets aren’t enough:**

* **Python & R:** Programming for data analysis, statistics, and visualization.
* **SQL:** Extracts and manipulates data from large databases.
* **Tableau / Google Data Studio:** Builds interactive dashboards with real-time updates.

### Dashboard Definition:

A **dashboard** tracks, analyzes, and displays KPIs dynamically in one place.

---

## **7. Creating Effective Presentations**

**Goal:** Communicate data insights clearly to stakeholders.

### Best Practices:

1. Progress **from general to specific**.
2. **State insights up front.**
3. **Repeat insights** while showing data visualizations.
4. Use **titles that reflect insights** (e.g., “Higher Spend = Higher ROAS”).
5. **Allow time for questions.**
6. End with a **call to action.**

### Sample Slide Layout:

1. Agenda
2. Background
3. Insights & Recommendations
4. Metrics & Data
5. Call to Action / Next Steps

---

## **8. Visualization Design Principles**

**Purpose:** Ensure visuals add clarity and value.

### Guidelines:

* **Choose best format:** Tables for executives, visuals for analysts.
* **Maximize data-ink ratio:** Use minimal colors, lines, and effects.
* **Orient labels** for easy reading.
* **Select colors thoughtfully:** Avoid red/green-only combinations.

### Evaluate Visuals:

Ask:

* Is the scale appropriate?
* Is the full data scope shown?
* Did I oversimplify trends?
* Do parts equal the whole (pie = 100%)?

---

## **9. Working with Stakeholders**

**Goal:** Communicate insights effectively and build trust.

### Key Practices:

* Anticipate stakeholder **needs and preferences**.
* Share data using **text + visuals**.
* Use **sorting, filtering, pivot tables, and charts** for clarity.
* Present data using **dashboards** when real-time tracking is needed.
* Remember: **Their success = your success.**
