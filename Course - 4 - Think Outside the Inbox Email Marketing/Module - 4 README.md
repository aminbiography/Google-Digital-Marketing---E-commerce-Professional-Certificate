## Data, Metrics, KPIs, and Reports
- **Data** – raw facts or numbers (e.g., 9,541 opens, 40,700 delivered).  
- **Metrics** – quantifiable measurements made from data.  
- **KPIs** – specific metrics chosen to measure campaign success.  
- **Reports** – collection of KPIs presented to stakeholders with visuals.  

***Data builds metrics → metrics become KPIs → KPIs form reports.***

## Common Email Marketing Metrics (with formulas)

- **Open rate**  
  \[ Open\ Rate = (Opens \div Emails\ Delivered) \times 100 \]  

- **Click-to-open rate (CTOR)**  
  \[ CTOR = (Clicks \div Unique\ Opens) \times 100 \]  

- **Unsubscribe rate**  
  \[ Unsubscribe\ Rate = (Unsubscribes \div Emails\ Delivered) \times 100 \]  

- **Complaint rate**  
  \[ Complaint\ Rate = (Complaints \div Emails\ Delivered) \times 100 \]  

- **Bounce rate**  
  \[ Bounce\ Rate = (Bounced\ Emails \div Emails\ Sent) \times 100 \]  

- **Conversion rate**  
  \[ Conversion\ Rate = (Conversions \div Emails\ Delivered) \times 100 \]  

- **Forward rate**  
  \[ Forward\ Rate = (Forwards \div Emails\ Delivered) \times 100 \]  

- **List growth rate**  
  \[ List\ Growth\ Rate = ((New\ Subs - Unsubs) \div Total\ List) \times 100 \]  

- **ROI (Return on Investment)**  
  \[ ROI = (Revenue \div Cost) \times 100 \]

## Insights from Metrics
- Declining open rates → improve subject lines.  
- High CTOR → add more clickable content.  
- High unsubscribes → adjust frequency/relevance.  
- Strong conversion/ROI → scale winning campaigns.

## Presenting to Stakeholders
- **Be concise**: focus only on essential KPIs.  
- **Be visual**: use graphs and dashboards.  
- **Be engaging**: tell stories, use case studies.  
- **Show growth**: tie metrics to business goals.  

---

## Tips for Presenting
- Speak clearly and slowly.  
- Pause at transitions or after questions.  
- Make eye contact (or look at the webcam).  
- Tell a story with a beginning, middle, and end.  
- Be concise – cut jargon.  
- Know your audience – adapt detail level.

## Case Example – Plot Twist Theater
- **Recent attendees** → best with pre-order promotions (20% open, 8% CTOR).  
- **Past attendees** → respond to last-minute & BOGO offers (12% open, 5% CTOR).  
- **Never attended** → motivated by BOGO/value promotions (7% open, 3% CTOR).  

***Segmenting strategy by subscriber type increases engagement and ticket sales.***

## Example Calculations

- **Conversion rate**  
  Purchases = 3,021, Delivered = 40,700  
  \[ 3,021 \div 40,700 \times 100 = 7.4\% \]  

- **ROI**  
  Revenue = $21,648, Cost = $867  
  \[ 21,648 \div 867 \times 100 = 2496\% \]  

- **List growth rate**  
  New subs = 1,398, Unsubs = 177, Total list = 29,495  
  \[ (1,398 - 177) \div 29,495 \times 100 = 4.1\% \]
