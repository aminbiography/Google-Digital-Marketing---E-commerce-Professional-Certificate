# Email Marketing Strategies: Lists, Segmentation & Automation

## Building an Email List
- Use **search engine marketing (SEM)** with website prompts (pop-ups, sign-ups) and customer surveys.  
- Other methods: display ads, social ads, referrals, and promotions.  
- The goal is to **grow a qualified subscriber base**.  

## Segmentation
- **Definition:** Dividing your email list into smaller groups to send more relevant messages.  
- Common ways:  
  - **Demographics** (age, gender, family status)  
  - **Geography** (location)  
  - **Psychographics** (lifestyle, hobbies, values)  
  - **Behavior** (purchasing habits, website activity, brand loyalty)  
- **Why:** Increases engagement, conversions, and personalization.  

## Demographics
- Examples: **age, gender identity, family status**.  
- These are **stable and consistent over time**, making them useful for targeted campaigns.  

## Call-to-Action (CTA)
- A **button or phrase** that encourages immediate action.  
- Examples: “Try it for free now,” “Pre-order today,” “Shop the sale.”  
- **Purpose:** Drive clicks, conversions, and engagement.  

## Merge / Personalization Tags
- Codes like **[First Name]** that pull unique subscriber data into emails.  
- Example: “Hi Sarah,” instead of “Hi Customer.”  
- Mistakes happen when tags don’t load properly → “Happy Birthday, [First Name]!”  

## Automation
- **Definition:** Tools that send emails automatically based on triggers or schedules.  
- Benefits: Saves time, ensures consistency, personalizes campaigns at scale.  
- Tools: **Mailchimp, HubSpot, Salesforce**.  

## Common Mistakes in Email Marketing
- Broken hyperlinks.  
- Sending to the wrong segmented list.  
- Personalization mistakes.  
- Outdated/incorrect information.  
- Typos.  

## Prevention of Mistakes (Quality Control)
- Double-check links.  
- Use grammar checkers.  
- Create a **Quality Control (QC) process** to review emails before sending.  
- Preview and test emails before launch.  

## Purpose, Narrative, and Tone
- **Purpose:** Why are you sending the email? (launch, sale, education, etc.)  
- **Narrative:** The story you tell. Example: who created the product, why the sale is happening.  
- **Tone:** How the email “sounds.” Examples:  
  - Product launch → enthusiastic, exciting.  
  - Newsletter → professional, helpful.  
  - Sale or holiday → spunky, thankful.

Great email marketing = **Strong list + smart segmentation + clear purpose + engaging narrative + right tone + automation + QC**
