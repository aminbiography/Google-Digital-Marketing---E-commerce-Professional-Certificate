]

**Total Expenses (TE):**
[

[
NP = TR - TE
]

[
NPM = \left(\frac{NP}{TR}\right) \times 100
]

---

### **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**

[
ROAS = \frac{\text{Ad-Attributed Revenue}}{\text{Ad Spend}}
]

---

## **8. Product Sourcing**

]

**Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth:**
[
\text{YoY%} = \left(\frac{\text{Sales}*{\text{This Year}} - \text{Sales}*{\text{Last Year}}}{\text{Sales}_{\text{Last Year}}}\right) \times 100
]

Use analytics dashboards and sales data to detect **seasonal trends** and plan inventory levels.

]

**Total Expenses (TE):**
[
TE = \text{COGS} + \text{Packaging} + \text{Shipping} + \text{Fulfillment} + \text{Advertising} + \text{Returns} + \text{Other Costs}
