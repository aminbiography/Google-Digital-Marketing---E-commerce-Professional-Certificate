Perfect ‚Äî yes! üéØ

If your goal is to make your **README.md** show proper **mathematical structure** (with fractions, exponents, and Greek letters rendered correctly), then yes ‚Äî we can use **LaTeX syntax with `$` delimiters**.

However, here‚Äôs the key point üëá

### ‚ö†Ô∏è GitHub currently **does not natively render** LaTeX math enclosed in `$...$` or `$$...$$`.

That means:

* On **GitHub.com**, you‚Äôll still see the raw math text (`$E = mc^2$`).
* But in **GitHub Codespaces**, **VS Code with Markdown Preview Enhanced**, **Obsidian**, **Typora**, **Jupyter**, or **Notion**,
  ‚Üí `$...$` and `$$...$$` *will render perfectly structured math.*

So if you want a **math-structured, portable version** (for Notion, Obsidian, or exporting as PDF),
I‚Äôll rewrite your full document using proper `$`-based math that **renders cleanly** in Markdown with MathJax support.

Here‚Äôs your improved version üëá

## **7. Product Research**

### **Formulas**

**Total Revenue (TR):**
$$
TR = \text{Units Sold} \times \text{Average Selling Price (ASP)}
$$

**Total Expenses (TE):**
$$
TE = \text{COGS} + \text{Packaging} + \text{Shipping} + \text{Fulfillment} + \text{Advertising} + \text{Returns} + \text{Other Costs}
$$

**Net Profit (NP):**
$$
NP = TR - TE
$$

**Net Profit Margin (NPM):**
$$
NPM = \left(\frac{NP}{TR}\right) \times 100
$$

**Example:**
$$
TR = 500 \times 800 = 400{,}000
$$
$$
TE = 280{,}000
$$
$$
NP = 400{,}000 - 280{,}000 = 120{,}000
$$
$$
NPM = \left(\frac{120{,}000}{400{,}000}\right) \times 100 = 30%
$$

---

### **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**

$$
ROAS = \frac{\text{Ad-Attributed Revenue}}{\text{Ad Spend}}
$$
**Example:**
$$
ROAS = \frac{360{,}000}{45{,}000} = 8
$$

---

## **8. Product Sourcing**

**Methods:**

1. **Create In-House:** High control & uniqueness, but costly.
2. **From Manufacturers:** Outsourced production; saves time but reduces control.
3. **Wholesalers:** Buy in bulk and resell; higher margin potential.
4. **Dropshipping:** Supplier ships directly to customer; low cost but low control.

**Consider:** Quality, shipping, fulfillment, profit margin, and time investment.

---

## **9. Forecasting Demand**

Forecasting predicts **future product demand** using data and trends.

**Key Methods:**

**Moving Average (MA):**
$$
MA_n(t) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \text{Sales}_{t-i}
$$

**Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth:**
$$
YoY% = \left(\frac{\text{Sales}*{\text{This Year}} - \text{Sales}*{\text{Last Year}}}{\text{Sales}_{\text{Last Year}}}\right) \times 100
$$

Use analytics dashboards and sales data to detect **seasonal trends** and plan inventory levels.

## **10. Branding**

Branding is the emotional and visual **identity of your business**.

**Core Elements:**

* Website design (layout, fonts, color scheme)
* Product quality and reliability
* Customer service and responsiveness

---

## **12. Key Ratios**

**Conversion Rate (CR):**
$$
CR = \left(\frac{\text{Conversions}}{\text{Website Visits}}\right) \times 100
$$

**Average Order Value (AOV):**
$$
AOV = \frac{\text{Revenue}}{\text{Number of Orders}}
$$

**Gross Margin:**
$$
\text{Gross Margin} = \left(\frac{\text{Revenue} - \text{COGS}}{\text{Revenue}}\right) \times 100
$$

---

## **13. Key Takeaways**

‚úÖ **Math will render perfectly** in:

* **Obsidian**, **Typora**, **Notion**, **Jupyter**, or **VS Code with MathJax support**
  ‚ùå It will *not* render on **GitHub.com‚Äôs README viewer** ‚Äî GitHub shows `$...$` as plain text.

---

Would you like me to make a **dual-compatible version** ‚Äî one that automatically looks structured *on GitHub* (using tables/code blocks) *and* shows LaTeX math correctly when exported (for Notion/PDF)?
That way, you can have one file that works in both environments.
