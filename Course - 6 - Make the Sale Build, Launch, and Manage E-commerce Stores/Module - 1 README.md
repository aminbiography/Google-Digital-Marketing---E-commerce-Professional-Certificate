## **7. Product Research**

### **Formulas**

**Total Revenue (TR):**

$$
TR = \text{Units Sold} \times \text{Average Selling Price (ASP)}
$$

**Total Expenses (TE):**

$$
TE = \text{COGS} + \text{Packaging} + \text{Shipping} + \text{Fulfillment} + \text{Advertising} + \text{Returns} + \text{Other Costs}
$$

**Net Profit (NP):**

$$
NP = TR - TE
$$

**Net Profit Margin (NPM):**

$$
NPM = \left(\frac{NP}{TR}\right) \times 100
$$

**Example:**

$$
TR = 500 \times 800 = 400{,}000
$$
$$
TE = 280{,}000
$$
$$
NP = 400{,}000 - 280{,}000 = 120{,}000
$$
$$
NPM = \left(\frac{120{,}000}{400{,}000}\right) \times 100 = 30%
$$

---

### **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**

$$
ROAS = \frac{\text{Ad-Attributed Revenue}}{\text{Ad Spend}}
$$

**Example:**

$$
ROAS = \frac{360{,}000}{45{,}000} = 8
$$

## **8. Product Sourcing**

**Methods:**

1. **Create In-House:** High control & uniqueness, but costly.
2. **From Manufacturers:** Outsourced production; saves time but reduces control.
3. **Wholesalers:** Buy in bulk and resell; higher margin potential.
4. **Dropshipping:** Supplier ships directly to customer; low cost but low control.

**Consider:** Quality, shipping, fulfillment, profit margin, and time investment.

---

## **9. Forecasting Demand**

Forecasting predicts **future product demand** using data and trends.

**Key Methods:**

**Moving Average (MA):**

$$
MA_n(t) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \text{Sales}_{t-i}
$$

**Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth:**

$$
YoY% = \left(\frac{\text{Sales}*{\text{This Year}} - \text{Sales}*{\text{Last Year}}}{\text{Sales}_{\text{Last Year}}}\right) \times 100
$$

Use analytics dashboards and sales data to detect **seasonal trends** and plan inventory levels.
