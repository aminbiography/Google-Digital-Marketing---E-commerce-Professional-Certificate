]

**Total Expenses (TE):**

[
TE = \text{COGS} + \text{Packaging} + \text{Shipping} + \text{Fulfillment} + \text{Advertising} + \text{Returns} + \text{Other Costs}
]

**Net Profit (NP):**

[
NP = TR - TE
]

**Net Profit Margin (NPM):**

[
NPM = \left(\frac{NP}{TR}\right) \times 100
]

ROAS = \frac{\text{Ad-Attributed Revenue}}{\text{Ad Spend}}
]

**Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth:**

[
\text{YoY%} = \left(\frac{\text{Sales}*{\text{This Year}} - \text{Sales}*{\text{Last Year}}}{\text{Sales}_{\text{Last Year}}}\right) \times 100
]

Use analytics dashboards and sales data to detect **seasonal trends** and plan inventory levels.
