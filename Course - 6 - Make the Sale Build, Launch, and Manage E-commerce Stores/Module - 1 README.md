## **7. Product Research**

### **Formulas**

**Total Revenue (TR)**

```
TR = Units Sold × Average Selling Price
```

**Total Expenses (TE)**

```
TE = COGS + Packaging + Shipping + Fulfillment + Advertising + Returns + Other Costs
```

**Net Profit (NP)**

```
NP = TR - TE
```

**Net Profit Margin (NPM)**

```
NPM = (NP ÷ TR) × 100
```

**Example:**

```
TR = 500 × 800 = $400,000
TE = $280,000
NP = 400,000 - 280,000 = $120,000
NPM = (120,000 ÷ 400,000) × 100 = 30%
```

---

### **ROAS (Return on Ad Spend)**

```
ROAS = Ad-Attributed Revenue ÷ Ad Spend
```

**Example:**

```
ROAS = 360,000 ÷ 45,000 = 8
```

→ Every $1 spent on ads earns $8 in sales.

```
MAₙ(t) = (Salesₜ + Salesₜ₋₁ + … + Salesₜ₋₍ₙ₋₁₎) ÷ n
```

**Year-over-Year (YoY) Growth:**

```
YoY% = ((Sales_this_year - Sales_last_year) ÷ Sales_last_year) × 100
```

Use analytics to find seasonal trends and plan inventory.
